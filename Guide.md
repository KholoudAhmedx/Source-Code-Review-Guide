# Source Code Review
Trying to secure systems only by finding and fixing vulnerabilities (pentesting) is an unfair fight that defenders are likely to lose. Therefore, we need to integrate proper code review function into the SDLC to produce better code from a security standpoint and a cost-effective software. </br>
## Secure Code Review & How to Introduce It Into Company's S-SDLC
This section discusses the advantages secure code review can bring to a development organization. </br>
**Objectives**: </br>
- Secure code techinques
- How code review compares other techniques for analyzing secure code. </br>
### Why Secure Code Review?
Secure code review is the single-most effective technique to identify security bugs early in the system development life cycle. When used together with manual and automated penetration testing, code review can significantly increase the cost effectivness of an application security verification effort. </br>
## How To Use The Code Review Guide
